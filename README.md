# editor
an online file management and text editor system for websites written in PHP and js

This is a sub project of the WebCP (http://webcp.pw) Web Hosting Control Panel project. 

NOTES:
1) This project is a number of years old and as such may not be up to modern coding standards. This should be changed
2) This was a sub project with user authentication handled elsewhere. Consequently using this project as is is not recommended (particularly on live systems) as it gives anyone unathenticated access to your files.
3) This file was set for a specific directory structure for the project it was made for.. As such we need to edit this to make it configurable
